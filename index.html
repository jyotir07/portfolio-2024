            <p style="color: black">
              As a software engineering student with ADHD, I've cultivated a
              diverse and robust skill set that bridges both technical and
              organizational arenas. In my academic journey, I've focused
              intensely on developing my problem-solving abilities in
              programming, allowing me to approach challenges with creativity
              and efficiency. Mastering essential data structures has further
              solidified my foundation, ensuring that my coding practices are
              both effective and optimized.
            </p>
            <p style="color: black">
              Beyond the classroom, my active involvement in a college committee
              has provided invaluable hands-on experience. Over the past few
              years, I've successfully planned and managed more than five
              significant events, each with its unique demands and logistical
              challenges. This experience has not only sharpened my event
              planning and project management skills but also taught me the
              importance of teamwork and adaptability. Additionally, I've had
              the honor of being a speaker at two of these events, which allowed
              me to refine my public speaking and presentation abilities. These
              engagements have enhanced my confidence and ability to communicate
              complex ideas clearly and engagingly.
            </p>
            <p style="color: black">
              Balancing my technical pursuits with organizational
              responsibilities has been a rewarding challenge. It has equipped
              me with a well-rounded skill set that encompasses both analytical
              thinking and practical execution. This blend of expertise ensures
              that I am well-prepared to tackle diverse challenges and
              contribute effectively to any team or project.

              When I was in 11th grade, I cracked into the admin's account from

              After that major incident, I developed an interest in programming
              and learning about computers. I made a few basic websites in
              school, while others were just learning html, I learnt about css
              and some basic javascript.
